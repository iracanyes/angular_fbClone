<!--
A template looks like regular HTML, except that it also contains Angular template syntax, which alters the HTML based on your application's logic and the state of application and DOM data.
Your template can use:
  - Data binding: to coordinate the application and DOM data
  - Pipes: to transform data before it's displayed
  - Directives: to apply application logic to what gets displayed
This template syntax tell angular how to render HTML to the screen using program logic and data:
  - *ngFor : directive that tells Angular to iterate over a list
  - {{ hero.name }}, [hero] : Bind program data to and from the DOM
  - (click) : Respond to user input
  - <app-crisis-detail> : Tag that represent a new component, HeroDetailComponent
-->
<!--
    DIRECTIVES:
    A component is technically a directive.
    However, components are so distinctive and central to Angular applications that Angular defines the @Component() decorator,
    which extends the @Directive() decorator with template-oriented features.
    There are two other kinds of directives: structural and attribute.
    you can define your own using the @Directive() decorator.
    Just as for components, the metadata for a directive associates the decorated class with a selector element that you use to insert it into HTML.
    In templates, directives typically appear within an element tag as attributes, either by name or as the target of an assignment or a binding.

      *ngFor: tells Angular to stamp out one <li> per hero in the heroes list.

      EVENT BINDING:
      (click) : calls 'selectHero' method when the user click a hero's name

  <!-- Directives
    *ngIf: tells Angular to include crisis-detail Component only if a selected hero exists.

  <!-- PROPERTY BINDING:
    [hero] : passes the value of selectedHero from the parent HeroListComponent to the "hero" property of the child HeroDetailComponent
